           <p>As PM Narendra Modi heads to France, the European Parliament Wednesday adopted a motion on the Manipur violence and said that it “denounces in the strongest terms nationalistic rhetoric deployed by leading members of the BJP party”, to which the Indian government responded that the issue is entirely an internal matter.</p> 
           <p>The debate on the ethnic clashes in Manipur was included in the Parliament’s agenda for a debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law during its ongoing plenary session in Strasbourg, France. The “motion for a European Parliament resolution on India, the situation in Manipur” has called for the European Union to “place human rights and democratic values at the heart of it’s engagement with India”.</p> 
           <p> Condemning the violence, loss of life and destruction of property in Manipur, the EU Parliament in its resolution said that it “denounces in the strongest terms nationalistic rhetoric deployed by leading members of the Bharatiya Janata Party.”</p> 
           <p>While the Indian government responded by saying that the issue is an entirely internal matter, the EU Parliament, in its scathing critique of the circumstances in the country, said that “minorities, civil society, human rights defenders and journalists regularly face harassment; whereas women in particular face severe challenges and violations of their rights often related to tribal and religious backgrounds, including sexual violence and harassment”.</p>

           </div> 
           <p>The resolution pointed out that in October 2020, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights had appealed to India to safeguard the rights of human rights defenders, raising concerns over shrinking space for civil society and has taken note of accusations made by human rights organisations against the BJP of “divisive ethnonationalistic policies.”</p>
            <p>“Whereas violence in India’s Manipur state has erupted along ethnic and religious lines between the mainly Hindu Meitei community and the Christian Kuki tribe, leading to a cycle of violence with over 100 people killed, over 40,000 displaced and the destruction of property and places of worship. Whereas Manipur has previously faced secessionist insurgencies in which serious human rights abuses were committed. Whereas, in the latest round of violence human rights groups have accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government in Manipur and nationally of implementing divisive ethnonationalistic policies which oppress in particular religious minorities,” the resolution said.</p>
