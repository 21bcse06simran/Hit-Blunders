          Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday urged people living
          in low-lying areas near the Yamuna river to immediately evacuate as
          the water level continued to rise after recording an all-time high.

          Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal during the press conference after
          the emergency meeting on Delhi Rainfall /waterlogged Yamuna Flood
          situation on Monday,Addressing a press conference, the chief minister
          said, “The water will enter your houses, there will be no time and it
          will be harmful for you and your life. Requesting everyone with folded
          hands, please don't wait.” Kejriwal also urged people to not click
          selfies or take videos of the flooded Yamuna as it could be dangerous.
          On the water levels of the Yamuna river, Kejriwal said, “The danger
          level of Delhi's Yamuna, which is 205.33, has been crossed and it has
          reached 207.71. Before today, the last time when the water level in
          the Yamuna river was the highest was in 1978, when the river flooded.
          Even then it was 207.49, which has also been crossed today. As per the
          prediction of the Central Water Commission, it will reach 207.72
          tonight. ”
        </p>
        <p>
          Kejriwal also said that Delhi had not received rainfall in the last
          two to three days. He said, “Water is entering Delhi from Himachal
          Pradesh and Haryana. Regarding this, I have also written a letter to
          Union Home Minister Amit Shah requesting him to reduce the flow of
          water entering Delhi, only then we can stop the Yamuna River from
          overflowing.” However, he said Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat has
          informed him that it was not possible to limit the flow rate of the
          river as there is no reservoir at Hathinikund Barrage. Shekhawat also
          told him that the volume of water being released to Haryana from
          Himachal Pradesh has reduced, which in turn will impact the water
          level in the Yamuna.

          But it will take some time for the water level in the river to recede,
          Kejriwal said. Urging people to evacuate, the chief minister said that
          he understood it was difficult to leave homes behind but low-lying
          areas would be worst affected. He listed out the areas that have
          already been affected. These included Boatclub, Monastery market,
          Neeli Chhatri temple, Yamunabazar, Majnu ka Tila to Wazirabad among
          other areas.

          However, Kejriwal said Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat has informed
          him that it was not possible to limit the flow rate of the river as
          there is no reservoir at Hathinikund Barrage. Shekhawat also told him
          that the volume of water being released to Haryana from Himachal
          Pradesh has reduced, which in turn will impact the water level in the
          Yamuna. Earlier, Kejriwal chaired an emergency meeting in Secretariat
          over the flood situation in Delhi. Ministers, Mayor and officials from
          various departments were present at the meeting. In a bid to ensure
          the safety of the public, Delhi Police on Wednesday imposed Section
          144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in flood-prone areas of the
          national capital as preventive measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Going with the present situation, two police stations located in
          flood-prone areas in North East Delhi have been ordered to shift to
          higher floors and other police stations in the vicinity have been
          instructed to be on alert as Yamuna River has breached the danger
          level and the water level continues to rise," an official said. Delhi
          government has already evacuated people living in low-lying areas and
          shifted them to safer places at higher altitudes. Police personnel and
          Civil Defence Volunteers at such locations and advisories are being
          issued to people to keep away from the river. Meanwhile, 2500 tents
          have been set up in 6 districts of the national capital to which
          people are being shifted. Those living in the affected areas are being
          shifted to these camps set up at higher places.
